# Scheduling Module - Work in Progress Status

## Branch: `feature/scheduling-tests-wip`

### What's Been Done ‚úÖ

1. **Database Verification**
   - All scheduling tables confirmed to exist in Supabase
   - Schema matches migration files

2. **Tests Created**
   - `conflict-resolver.test.ts` - 10/10 tests passing ‚úÖ
   - `route-optimization.integration.test.ts` - 3/4 tests passing (Mapbox API working)
   - `schedule-conflict.service.test.ts` - 4/9 tests passing
   - `kit.service.test.ts` - Created but services not implemented
   - `sync-queue.test.ts` - Created but services not implemented

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Added MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN to environment.ts config
   - Mapbox API integration confirmed working
   - Added fake-indexeddb for offline testing

4. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed logger imports (changed from voice-logger to createLogger)
   - Added missing methods to ScheduleConflictService
   - Created offline types definitions

### What Needs to Be Done üöß

1. **Complete Service Implementations**
   - [ ] Finish ScheduleConflictService methods
   - [ ] Implement missing repository classes:
     - [ ] KitRepository
     - [ ] KitItemRepository
     - [ ] KitVariantRepository
     - [ ] KitAssignmentRepository
   - [ ] Create SyncQueueService class
   - [ ] Create IndexedDBService class

2. **Fix Failing Tests**
   - [ ] Schedule conflict edge cases (day boundary, break calculations)
   - [ ] Time zone handling in findOptimalSlot
   - [ ] Kit service full implementation
   - [ ] Sync queue implementation

3. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Test full offline sync flow
   - [ ] Test Mapbox route optimization with real addresses
   - [ ] Test kit loading with variants and overrides
   - [ ] Test voice command integration

### How to Continue on Another Machine

1. Clone the repo and checkout the feature branch:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/etzlertech/jobeye.git
cd jobeye
git checkout feature/scheduling-tests-wip
npm install
```

2. Run tests to see current state:
```bash
# Run all scheduling tests
npm test src/scheduling

# Run specific test suites
npm test src/scheduling/offline/__tests__/conflict-resolver.test.ts  # ‚úÖ All passing
npm test src/scheduling/services/__tests__/route-optimization.integration.test.ts  # ‚ö†Ô∏è 3/4 passing
npm test src/scheduling/services/__tests__/schedule-conflict.service.test.ts  # ‚ö†Ô∏è 4/9 passing
```

3. Check database connection:
```bash
npm run check:db-actual
```

### Key Files Modified

- `src/core/config/environment.ts` - Added MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN
- `src/scheduling/services/schedule-conflict.service.ts` - Added test methods
- `src/scheduling/services/route-optimization.service.ts` - Fixed logger import
- `src/scheduling/offline/conflict-resolver.ts` - Fixed logger import
- `src/scheduling/offline/conflict-resolver-simple.ts` - Working implementation
- `src/scheduling/offline/types/offline.types.ts` - Type definitions

### Environment Variables Needed

Make sure `.env.local` has:
```
MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoidG9waGFuZHRlY2giLCJhIjoiY21nNWowdTkxMDVmdjJqcTRuaDBzdDBpcSJ9.HlrEVtagnz_vn_S2BBKeRg
```

### Next Development Steps

1. Start with implementing the missing repositories in `src/scheduling/repositories/`
2. Then implement SyncQueueService and IndexedDBService
3. Fix the remaining test failures
4. Add API endpoint tests
5. Test the complete flow end-to-end

### Notes

- The scheduling module structure is solid
- Core functionality design is proven by passing tests
- Main work needed is completing implementations
- All database tables exist and are ready
