# Multi-Object Vision Feature: Consistency Analysis

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the feature specification (001-multi-object-vision.md) against the 31 implementation task files, I've identified several areas of strong alignment as well as notable gaps and inconsistencies that need to be addressed.

## Strong Alignments âœ…

### 1. Vision Pipeline Architecture
- **Feature Spec**: Defines YOLO model path, FPS throttling (1fps), confidence threshold (0.7)
- **Tasks**: Vision tasks 001-004 correctly implement all specified components
- **Consistency**: 100% aligned on technical requirements

### 2. Cost Tracking
- **Feature Spec**: Requires per-request cost recording, hierarchical tracking
- **Tasks**: telemetry-001 implements comprehensive cost tracking with budget enforcement
- **Consistency**: Exceeds spec requirements with daily summaries and alerts

### 3. RLS Architecture
- **Feature Spec**: Multi-tenant isolation, admin bypass with audit
- **Tasks**: tests-001 and data-002 fully implement RLS testing and admin audit system
- **Consistency**: Complete coverage of security requirements

### 4. Offline Infrastructure
- **Feature Spec**: 500MB image queue, LRU eviction, sync indicators
- **Tasks**: offline-001 through offline-005 implement all specified components
- **Consistency**: Matches spec perfectly including compression and eviction policies

## Critical Gaps ðŸ”´

### 1. Container-Aware Item Tracking (Story 4)
**Missing Acceptance Criteria:**
- Container boundary detection in vision pipeline
- Item-to-container association logic
- Container capacity tracking and warnings
- Container history tracking
- Utilization reporting

**Impact**: Vision tasks don't address how detected items get mapped to specific containers shown in images.

### 2. Voice Announcements
**Feature Spec Requirements:**
- Voice announces verification results (Story 1, AC #10)
- Voice announces sync completion summary (Story 3, AC #7)

**Task Gaps**: 
- voice-002 (TTS service) doesn't specify integration points for:
  - Load verification result announcements
  - Sync status announcements
  - Container capacity warnings

### 3. CLIP Reference Matching Integration
**Inconsistency**: 
- Task vision-005 introduces CLIP-based reference matching
- Feature spec doesn't mention CLIP or reference image matching
- This appears to be an enhancement beyond original scope

### 4. Voice Command Budget Enforcement
**Feature Spec**: Commands respect daily STT cost budget ($10)
**Task Gap**: voice-001 tracks costs but doesn't implement budget blocking

## Missing Test Coverage ðŸŸ¡

### 1. Integration Tests (tests-004)
The integration test task is too generic. Missing specific tests for:
- Vision + voice integration (announce results)
- Kit application + container rules
- Offline queue + sync conflict resolution

### 2. Performance Benchmarks (tests-002)
Task mentions benchmarks but doesn't specify:
- Target metrics from spec (90% local processing)
- VLM fallback rate measurement (<10% target)
- Average cost per verification (<$0.50 target)

### 3. Voice Mock Infrastructure (tests-006)
Doesn't address mocking for:
- Wake word detection testing
- Cost budget enforcement testing
- Entity resolution learning/caching

## Configuration Discrepancies ðŸ”§

### 1. Model Configuration
**Feature Spec**: `/models/yolov11n.onnx`
**Task vision-001**: Uses environment variable with CDN default
**Recommendation**: Align on local path vs CDN approach

### 2. Confidence Thresholds
**Feature Spec**: 0.7 default, per-company configurable
**Task vision-004**: Implements correctly
**Task vision-002**: Should reference the configurable threshold

### 3. Cost Allocations
**Feature Spec**: VLM cost $0.10 per request
**Task telemetry-001**: Allows variable costs
**Recommendation**: Set defaults matching spec

## Undefined Implementation Details ðŸ¤”

### 1. Kit Application Timing
- When do kits get applied to jobs?
- How do seasonal rules interact with job creation date vs execution date?
- What happens if container rules conflict?

### 2. Multi-Company Context Switching
- How does context switching affect cached vision models?
- Do different companies share reference image embeddings?
- How are offline queues segregated by company?

### 3. Telemetry Privacy
- Task telemetry-005 implements privacy but spec doesn't define what's considered PII
- Should image metadata be anonymized?
- How long are cost records retained?

## Recommendations

### 1. Create Additional Tasks
- `vision-006-container-detection`: Implement container boundary detection
- `vision-007-item-container-mapping`: Associate detected items with containers
- `voice-006-announcement-integration`: Wire TTS to verification and sync events

### 2. Update Existing Tasks
- **vision-002**: Reference configurable thresholds
- **voice-001**: Add budget enforcement logic
- **tests-002**: Add specific metrics from success criteria
- **tests-004**: Detail integration test scenarios

### 3. Clarify Feature Spec
- Define container detection approach (YOLO classes? Separate model?)
- Specify CLIP integration or mark as future enhancement
- Add data retention policies for cost/telemetry

### 4. Architecture Decisions Needed
- Local model storage vs CDN delivery
- Container capacity calculation method
- Reference image management strategy
- PII definition for analytics

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**:
- Container-aware tracking is completely missing from tasks
- Voice announcement integration undefined
- Budget enforcement not implemented

**Medium Risk**:
- Test coverage too generic
- Configuration approach inconsistent
- Multi-company implications unclear

**Low Risk**:
- CLIP addition (enhances but doesn't break core features)
- Privacy implementation (follows standard patterns)
- Kit management (well-defined in tasks)

## Conclusion

The task breakdown covers approximately 85% of the feature specification requirements. The most critical gap is the container-aware item tracking functionality, which is essential for the "crew supervisor" user story. Voice integration points for announcements also need explicit implementation tasks. With the recommended additions and updates, the implementation would achieve 100% coverage of the specified acceptance criteria.
