## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18
- Q: How should this feature relate to the existing workflow_tasks table? ‚Üí A: Enhance existing - Extend workflow_tasks with missing features (add columns/capabilities)
- Q: Should the system support reusable task templates? ‚Üí A: Yes, templates required - Supervisors must be able to create reusable task templates for job types
- Q: Can technicians add or remove tasks after a job has started? ‚Üí A: Add only, no delete - Can add tasks but cannot remove tasks after job starts
- Q: Can a job be marked as complete when some tasks remain incomplete? ‚Üí A: Required tasks only - Required tasks must be complete, optional tasks can be incomplete
- Q: Does AI confidence scoring align with vision pipeline strategy? ‚Üí A: Yes, keep VLM scoring - Continue using Vision Language Models for AI confidence on task verification

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a field technician**, I want to see a clear list of tasks I need to complete for each job so that I can work through the job systematically without missing critical steps, even when working offline or in hands-free mode.

**As a supervisor**, I want to define standard task lists for different job types so that all technicians follow consistent procedures and quality standards.

**As an office administrator**, I want to track which tasks have been completed for each job so that I can verify work quality and identify bottlenecks in job completion.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a job is assigned to me, **When** I open the job details via voice command "Show job tasks", **Then** I hear a numbered list of all tasks I need to complete in order

2. **Given** I'm working through a task list, **When** I complete a task and say "Mark task 3 complete", **Then** the task is marked complete, a timestamp is recorded, and the system confirms completion audibly

3. **Given** a task requires photo verification, **When** I complete the task, **Then** the system prompts me to take a verification photo before allowing me to mark it complete

4. **Given** I'm working offline, **When** I complete multiple tasks, **Then** all task completions are queued locally and sync automatically when connectivity is restored

5. **Given** I'm a supervisor creating a new job, **When** I select a job template, **Then** the associated task list is automatically added to the job

6. **Given** a task requires supervisor approval, **When** I mark it complete, **Then** the supervisor receives a notification and the task shows "pending approval" status

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a technician skips a task and completes later tasks out of order?
- How does the system handle tasks that become irrelevant mid-job? Tasks must be marked "skipped" rather than deleted after job starts
- What happens if a task requires verification but the camera is unavailable?
- How are task lists managed when a job is rescheduled or reassigned?
- Can technicians reorder tasks after job starts, or is sequence locked?
- What happens if a technician tries to complete a job with incomplete required tasks? System must block completion and identify which required tasks remain
- Can a required task be changed to optional after job starts?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

#### Task Item Properties
- **FR-010**: Each task MUST have a description/title
- **FR-011**: Each task MUST have a required/optional flag
- **FR-012**: Each task MUST have a status (pending, in-progress, complete, skipped, failed)

- **FR-024**: System MUST support voice command to add new tasks ("Add task: Check backup generator")

#### Multi-Tenant & Security
- **FR-025**: System MUST enforce tenant isolation for all task data (inherit from job's tenant_id)
- **FR-026**: System MUST enforce tenant isolation for task templates
- **FR-027**: System MUST respect user role permissions for task operations (create, update, complete vs. template management)
- **FR-028**: System MUST implement RLS policies for task data access
- **FR-029**: System MUST audit all task completion events with user and timestamp

#### Integration with Existing Features
- **FR-030**: System MUST enhance existing workflow_tasks table with missing capabilities (not create new table)
- **FR-031**: System MUST integrate with existing job workflow (jobs table)
- **FR-032**: System MUST support task verification using existing photo/vision pipeline (VLM-first approach per constitution)
- **FR-033**: System MUST respect existing supervisor review workflows
- **FR-034**: System MUST validate all required tasks are complete before allowing job completion
- **FR-035**: System MUST allow job completion when only optional tasks remain incomplete

#### Data Retention & History
- **FR-036**: System MUST retain task completion history for audit purposes
- **FR-037**: System MUST retain task data for duration aligned with tenant policy (defer specific period to planning phase)
- **FR-038**: System MUST allow viewing historical task lists for completed jobs

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task List**: A collection of tasks associated with a specific job, ordered sequentially
  - Belongs to exactly one job
  - Inherits tenant_id from parent job
  - May be created from a template (if templates are supported)
  - Contains multiple task items

- **Task Item**: An individual work item that must be completed as part of a job
  - Has description, order/sequence number, status
  - Tracks completion (who, when)
  - May require verification (photo, supervisor approval)
  - May have acceptance criteria and AI confidence scoring
  - Inherits tenant isolation through parent job relationship

- **Task Template**: A reusable definition of tasks for specific job types
  - Tenant-scoped (isolated per tenant)
  - Defines standard task sequences for common job types (e.g., "HVAC Maintenance", "Electrical Inspection")
  - Instantiated when job is created from template
  - Contains template task definitions with order, description, verification requirements

## Database Evidence *(captured during specification)*

### Supabase MCP Queries Executed

**Query 1 - Jobs Table Schema** (2025-10-18)
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'jobs'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```
**Key Findings**:
- Jobs table has tenant_id (uuid, NOT NULL)
- Has job_number, customer_id, property_id, assigned_to, assigned_team
- Has checklist_items (jsonb, default '[]'::jsonb) - currently storing as JSONB
- Has RLS policy 'jobs_tenant_isolation' for ALL operations
- Has voice-related fields: voice_notes, voice_created, voice_session_id

**Query 2 - Existing Task-Related Tables** (2025-10-18)
```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND (tablename LIKE '%job%' OR tablename LIKE '%task%')
ORDER BY tablename;
```
**Key Findings**:
- `job_checklist_items` exists (14 columns, links to jobs via job_id)
- `workflow_tasks` exists (20 columns, has tenant_id, job_id, task_description, task_order, status, completion tracking, verification fields, supervisor approval fields)
- This indicates task functionality may already partially exist!

**Query 3 - workflow_tasks Schema** (2025-10-18)
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'workflow_tasks'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```
**Key Findings**:
- Has tenant_id (uuid, NOT NULL) - proper multi-tenant isolation
- Has job_id (uuid, NOT NULL) - links to jobs table
- Has task_description, task_order, status, task_type
- Has completion tracking: completed_by, completed_at
- Has verification: verification_photo_url, verification_method, verification_data, ai_confidence
- Has supervisor workflow: requires_supervisor_approval, supervisor_approved, supervisor_id, supervisor_notes
- **CRITICAL**: This table already implements most of the required functionality!
