# Feature Specification: Job Assignment and Crew Hub Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `010-job-assignment-and`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Job Assignment and Crew Hub Dashboard - Enable supervisors to assign jobs to crew members, and create a crew dashboard showing assigned jobs in load order. First, get Job Assignment working where super@tophand.tech user can assign a job to crew@tophand.tech user. Then, make the Crew Hub screen have same look and design as supervisor dashboard, and it will have a My Jobs section on dash that shows ALL assigned jobs in order of 'next to load', and these job tiles (2 per row) each open the Item Load List screen if there are items remaining to load."

## Execution Flow (main)
```

   ‚Üí Actions: assign jobs, view assigned jobs, load items
   ‚Üí Data: jobs, assignments, items, load status
   ‚Üí Constraints: matching supervisor UI design, load order sorting
3. Mark unclear aspects ‚Üí See NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers below
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úì
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úì
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úì

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-16
- Q: "Next to load" priority: How should jobs be ordered in the crew member's dashboard? ‚Üí A: Scheduled start time (earliest first)
- Q: Crew member permissions: What can crew members do with assigned jobs besides viewing and updating load status? ‚Üí A: Can edit job notes/comments only
- Q: Multiple crew assignment: Can one job be assigned to multiple crew members simultaneously? ‚Üí A: Yes, multiple crew can be assigned to same job
- Q: Fully loaded job interaction: What happens when a crew member taps a job tile with all items already loaded? ‚Üí A: Navigate to job details page (read-only view)
- Q: Crew member role determination: How is crew member status identified for job assignment purposes? ‚Üí A: Database role field (e.g., users.role = 'crew')

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a supervisor**, I need to assign jobs to crew members so that they know which jobs they're responsible for and can start loading the required items for those jobs.

**As a crew member**, I need to see all my assigned jobs in priority order so that I can efficiently load items for the next job that needs attention.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Job Assignment Flow
1. **Given** a supervisor is viewing a job details page, **When** they select "Assign to Crew", **Then** they can select a crew member from a list and assign the job to them
2. **Given** a job has been assigned to a crew member, **When** the crew member logs in, **Then** they see this job in their "My Jobs" section
3. **Given** multiple jobs are assigned to a crew member, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** jobs are sorted by scheduled start time (earliest first)

#### Crew Hub Dashboard Flow
4. **Given** a crew member has assigned jobs, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** they see job tiles in a 2-column grid matching the supervisor dashboard design
5. **Given** a job tile has items remaining to load, **When** the crew member taps the job tile, **Then** they are taken to the Item Load List screen for that job
6. **Given** a job tile has all items loaded, **When** the crew member taps the job tile, **Then** they are taken to a read-only job details page

#### Load Status Visibility
7. **Given** a job has 5 items with 3 loaded, **When** viewing the job tile, **Then** the load status shows "3/5" with a progress indicator
8. **Given** a job is assigned but has no items, **When** viewing the job tile, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should it show "0/0", hide the load count, or indicate no items assigned?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a supervisor unassigns a job from a crew member while they're viewing it?
- How does the system handle a job assigned to a crew member who doesn't have an active account?
- What happens if a crew member is assigned multiple jobs with the same scheduled start time?
- What happens when multiple crew members update the same job's load status simultaneously?
- Can a crew member decline or reassign a job? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Outstanding Clarifications (Deferred)

The following clarifications remain but are lower impact and can be resolved during planning or implementation:

1. **Job with no items**: How should the UI display jobs that have no items assigned? (UI detail - can be decided during design)
2. **Job reassignment confirmation**: Should removal require confirmation or preserve history? (UX polish - default to no confirmation)
3. **Assignment notifications**: Notification method (in-app, email, push)? (Feature enhancement - defer to Phase 2)
4. **Crew member job visibility**: Can they see unassigned/other jobs? (Security consideration - default to assigned-only)
5. **Assignment history**: Is audit trail required? (Compliance decision - recommend yes for accountability)
6. **Concurrent update handling**: Conflict resolution strategy? (Technical - last-write-wins acceptable for MVP)
7. **Performance targets**: Load time thresholds? (Non-functional - use industry standard <3s)
8. **Offline support**: Required and sync strategy? (Feature scope - defer to Phase 2)

**Status**: Ready to proceed to `/plan` with 5 core clarifications resolved.
