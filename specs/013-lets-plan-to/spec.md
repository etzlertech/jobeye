# Feature Specification: Template and Task Image Management

**Feature Branch**: `013-lets-plan-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "lets plan to add thumbnail images to all template summary cards and task cards; and medium images to all Details pages for task templates and Task Detail pages; lets create a Task Details page if we do not have one (similar to Task Template Details and other detail pages); and lets make adding images via Camera OR file Upload match the other Detail pages for uniformity of UI UX and of shared code;"

## Execution Flow (main)
```

   ‚Üí Actions: Add images, view images, upload via camera/file
   ‚Üí Data: Thumbnails for cards, medium images for details, full images for storage
   ‚Üí Constraints: Match existing image upload patterns
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Size requirements for thumbnails and medium images defined by existing patterns
   ‚Üí Task Details page needs to be created
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flows for adding images to templates and tasks
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Task templates, tasks, images (three sizes)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Focused on user value

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a supervisor**, I want to add images to task templates so that workers can visually identify what tasks look like and have a clearer understanding of the work to be performed.

**As a supervisor**, I want to view task template images in both list view (thumbnails) and detail view (medium-sized images) so I can quickly scan templates and see detailed visuals when needed.

**As a supervisor**, I want to add images to individual tasks so that specific task instances can have their own visual references separate from the template.

**As a worker**, I want to see task images on task cards and detail pages so I can quickly identify tasks visually and understand what work needs to be done.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a supervisor is creating or editing a task template, **When** they access the template detail page, **Then** they must be able to add an image using either camera capture or file upload

2. **Given** a supervisor has added an image to a task template, **When** they view the template list page, **Then** they must see a thumbnail version of the image on the template card

3. **Given** a supervisor views a task template detail page with an image, **When** the page loads, **Then** they must see a medium-sized version of the image clearly displayed

4. **Given** a supervisor is viewing a task (not template), **When** they access the task detail page, **Then** they must be able to add, view, or change the task's image

5. **Given** a worker views a task list, **When** tasks have images, **Then** thumbnail images must appear on each task card

6. **Given** any user captures a photo using the camera, **When** the photo is taken, **Then** the system must create thumbnail, medium, and full-size versions automatically

7. **Given** any user uploads an image file, **When** the file is processed, **Then** the system must create thumbnail, medium, and full-size versions automatically

8. **Given** a task template has an image, **When** tasks are created from that template, **Then** tasks must inherit the template's image by default but allow independent updates

9. **Given** a user is on any detail page with image upload capability, **When** they interact with the image upload interface, **Then** the interface must match the existing pattern (camera button and upload button)

10. **Given** a task detail page does not currently exist, **When** this feature is implemented, **Then** a task detail page must be created following the same pattern as template detail pages

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to upload an unsupported image format (e.g., HEIC)?
  - System must display a clear error message and reject the upload

- What happens when a template image is updated after tasks have been created from it?
  - Existing task images remain unchanged (tasks maintain their own images independently)

- What happens when a user uploads an extremely large image file?
  - System must process and resize the image to create optimized thumbnail, medium, and full versions

- What happens when a user denies camera permissions?
  - System must display an appropriate error message and fall back to file upload option

- What happens when viewing a template or task card without an image?
  - System must display a placeholder or icon indicating no image is set

- What happens when viewing a template or task detail page without an image?
  - System must display the option to add an image via camera or file upload

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Image Display Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display thumbnail images (approximately 150x150 pixels) on task template summary cards in list views

- **NFR-005**: The user interface for image management must be intuitive and require no training

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

## Clarifications

### Session 1 (2025-10-19)
No clarifications were required. The user provided a clear, detailed description that specified:
- What components need images (template cards, task cards, detail pages)
- What image sizes to use (thumbnails for cards, medium for details)
- What functionality is needed (camera and file upload)
- What consistency requirement exists (match existing detail page patterns)
- What missing component needs creation (Task Detail page)

All requirements could be derived directly from this description combined with examination of existing patterns in the codebase.
