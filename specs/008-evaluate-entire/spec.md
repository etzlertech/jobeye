# Feature Specification: Codebase Redundancy Analysis and Cleanup

**Feature Branch**: `008-evaluate-entire`  
**Created**: 2025-01-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "evaluate entire codebase - how much redundant code do we have? where we have been specing and building out functionality in different folders and feature sets etc that are not connected and not doing anything except creating confusion and overlapping nonworking code?"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team lead, I need to understand the current state of code redundancy and overlapping implementations across the codebase, so that I can prioritize cleanup efforts and reduce maintenance overhead, confusion, and development inefficiencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a complete codebase with multiple features and domains, **When** the redundancy analysis is performed, **Then** a comprehensive report is generated showing all duplicate implementations, overlapping functionality, and unused code segments

2. **Given** identified redundant code segments, **When** reviewing the analysis report, **Then** each redundancy is categorized by type (duplicate logic, overlapping features, disconnected code) with specific file locations and impact assessment

3. **Given** database tables and schema definitions, **When** analyzing table usage, **Then** the system identifies which tables have corresponding application code (CRUD operations) and which are abandoned or unused

4. **Given** multiple implementations of the same feature, **When** evaluating the duplicates, **Then** the report provides recommendations on which implementation to keep and which to remove

### Edge Cases
- What happens when code appears similar but serves different purposes?
- How does system handle partially implemented features that may appear as unused?
- What about code that is referenced but never executed?
- How to distinguish between deliberate redundancy (e.g., backups, failovers) vs accidental duplication?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify all duplicate implementations of the same functionality across different folders and domains
- **FR-002**: System MUST map all database tables to their corresponding application code implementations
- **FR-003**: System MUST categorize redundancies into types: duplicate code, overlapping features, unused/abandoned code, and disconnected implementations
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide impact assessment for each redundancy showing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what metrics determine impact - lines of code, number of dependencies, frequency of use?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate actionable recommendations for consolidation with priority levels
- **FR-006**: System MUST identify code that exists but has no entry points or is never called
- **FR-007**: System MUST track feature specifications that have multiple implementations
- **FR-008**: Report MUST include visualization of code organization showing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what type of visualization - dependency graphs, folder structure maps, heat maps?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect API endpoints that duplicate functionality
- **FR-010**: Analysis MUST cover [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific code types - only application code or also tests, configurations, documentation?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST identify database tables without CRUD operations
- **FR-012**: Report MUST be exportable in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what formats - PDF, HTML, JSON, Markdown?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle codebases of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what size limits - number of files, total lines of code?]
- **FR-014**: Analysis MUST complete within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable time frame - minutes, hours?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST respect [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: any files/folders to exclude from analysis?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Redundancy Finding**: Represents a discovered instance of duplicate or overlapping code, including type, locations, impact score, and recommendation
- **Code Module**: A logical unit of code (file, class, function) that may have duplicates or overlaps with other modules
- **Database Table Mapping**: Links database tables to their application code implementations, identifying orphaned tables
- **Feature Implementation**: Maps feature specifications to their actual code implementations, highlighting multiple implementations
- **Analysis Report**: The comprehensive output containing all findings, categorizations, and recommendations
