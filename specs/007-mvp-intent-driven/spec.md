## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Field service companies need a mobile app where supervisors can manage inventory, create jobs, and assign work to crew members. Crew members need to efficiently verify equipment loads using their phone camera and report job status back to supervisors. The system should intelligently understand user intent when they point their camera at items, receipts, or equipment issues. All interactions should be possible through voice commands or simple button choices (max 4 per screen) with AI assistance throughout.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**User Onboarding & Admin:**

1. **Given** a new user signs up, **When** they complete registration, **Then** they are assigned Crew role by default
2. **Given** Super Admin (Mr TopHand) is logged in, **When** they view user management, **Then** they can change any user's role between Crew and Supervisor
3. **Given** user interacts with any screen, **When** making choices, **Then** maximum 4 action buttons are displayed

**Supervisor Workflows:**

4. **Given** supervisor is logged in, **When** they speak "Create new customer", **Then** STT‚ÜíLLM‚ÜíTTS pipeline guides them through customer creation
5. **Given** supervisor points camera at a new tool, **When** system detects it's not in inventory, **Then** it offers to add with VLM assistance
6. **Given** supervisor creates entities (property, vehicle, building), **When** capturing images, **Then** system generates square thumbnails
7. **Given** supervisor has added items to inventory, **When** they create a new job, **Then** they can assign inventory items or predefined kits
8. **Given** supervisor assigns job to crew, **When** assignment completes, **Then** crew member receives notification
9. **Given** jobs are active, **When** supervisor asks "Show job status", **Then** voice response provides real-time updates

**Crew Member Workflows:**

10. **Given** crew member logs in, **When** they view dashboard, **Then** they see assigned jobs with details (time, location, special instructions)
11. **Given** crew member has pending job, **When** they point camera at equipment, **Then** VLM assists with load verification
12. **Given** crew member is on job, **When** they speak "Check off task", **Then** STT‚ÜíLLM guides them through task completion
13. **Given** load list is verified, **When** crew confirms completion, **Then** supervisor receives real-time notification
14. **Given** crew encounters equipment issue, **When** they capture image, **Then** system recognizes maintenance event with voice note option

**General Intent Recognition:**

15. **Given** any user points camera at paper receipt, **When** system detects receipt format, **Then** it offers to scan and record expense
16. **Given** camera is active, **When** user presses Start button, **Then** system begins 1fps capture and intent analysis

**Vehicle/Container Management:**

17. **Given** supervisor points camera at company vehicle, **When** system detects vehicle, **Then** it offers to add to vehicle inventory with square thumbnail
18. **Given** items are in inventory, **When** supervisor assigns them to containers, **Then** system tracks item location hierarchy
19. **Given** job requires specific vehicle, **When** supervisor creates job, **Then** they can assign required vehicles/containers
20. **Given** supervisor has container "Storage Box 3", **When** they assign it to "Truck Bed 2" on "Truck 1", **Then** system maintains full hierarchy path
21. **Given** user searches for an item, **When** item is in nested container, **Then** system shows complete location path (e.g., "Wrench ‚Üí Box 3 ‚Üí Truck Bed 2 ‚Üí Truck 1")

**Data Capture for Analytics:**

22. **Given** any AI interaction occurs, **When** system processes request, **Then** it logs prompt, image, response, timing, and cost
23. **Given** new entity is created, **When** image is captured, **Then** system generates and stores square thumbnail for display

### Edge Cases
- What happens when camera can't identify intent after [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timeout period]?
- How does system handle poor lighting or blurry images during verification?
- What if crew member doesn't have assigned job but scans inventory items?
- How does app handle offline mode transitions (manual checkbox vs AI verification)?
- What if multiple intents are possible (e.g., item could be inventory add OR job verification)?
- What if user tries to create circular container references (e.g., Box A ‚Üí Box B ‚Üí Box A)?
- How does system handle moving items between containers with different hierarchies?
- What happens when a parent container is deleted but has child containers?
