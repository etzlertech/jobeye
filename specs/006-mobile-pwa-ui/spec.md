# Feature Specification: Mobile PWA Vision UI

**Feature Branch**: `006-mobile-pwa-ui`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Mobile PWA UI with real-time YOLO vision detection at 1fps and VLM fallback for equipment verification"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: When the device is offline and verification records are queued locally, what is the maximum number of verification records the system should preserve? ‚Üí A: 200 records (1 week of typical work)
- Q: When the device camera is unavailable (permissions denied, hardware failure, or browser incompatibility), what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Fallback to manual checklist (tap to verify each item)
- Q: How long should the system retain verification records (photos, detection results, metadata) before automatic deletion? ‚Üí A: 30 days (1 month minimal compliance)
- Q: When equipment is only partially visible in the camera frame (e.g., item is cut off at edge, partially obscured), how should the system respond? ‚Üí A: Prompt user to reposition camera for full visibility
- Q: When on-device YOLO detection fails to identify equipment within a reasonable time (processing stalls or takes too long), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Retry 3 times, then fallback to VLM cloud detection

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **field technician**, I need to verify my truck is fully loaded with required equipment before leaving the yard, so that I can complete all scheduled jobs without delays from missing tools.

**Current Pain Points:**
- Manual checklists are tedious and error-prone
- Forgotten equipment causes return trips (wasted time/fuel)
- Paper checklists get lost or damaged
- No proof of loading verification

**Desired Outcome:**
- Quick visual confirmation of all equipment present
- Automatic detection reduces manual checking
- Offline-capable for poor network areas
- Digital proof of verification with timestamp

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** technician has loaded equipment in truck bed, **When** they open the mobile app and point camera at truck bed, **Then** system displays live camera feed with detected equipment highlighted

2. **Given** equipment detection is running at 1fps, **When** technician holds camera steady for 3 seconds, **Then** system identifies all visible equipment items and marks them as verified

3. **Given** detection confidence is low (<70%), **When** system cannot confidently identify an item, **Then** system requests secondary verification through cloud vision service

4. **Given** all required equipment is detected, **When** technician captures final photo, **Then** system creates verification record with timestamp, photo, and detected items list

5. **Given** technician is in offline mode, **When** they complete equipment verification, **Then** system queues verification locally and syncs when network available

6. **Given** one or more required items are missing, **When** detection completes, **Then** system displays clear visual indicator of missing items and prevents job start

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when camera is unavailable?** System automatically falls back to manual checklist mode where user taps each item to mark as verified
- **What happens when lighting is poor?** System should prompt user to improve lighting or allow manual verification override
- **What happens when equipment is partially visible?** System prompts user to reposition camera to capture full item visibility before accepting detection
- **What happens when detection times out?** System retries on-device detection 3 times, then automatically triggers VLM cloud fallback
- **What happens when offline queue is full?** System evicts oldest-first (FIFO) when 200 record limit reached, displays warning to user

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Camera & Detection**
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide live camera feed at minimum 1 frame per second refresh rate
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect equipment items in real-time using on-device vision processing
- **FR-003**: System MUST display visual indicators overlaying detected equipment items on camera feed
- **FR-004**: System MUST calculate and display confidence score for each detected item
- **FR-005**: System MUST trigger cloud vision (VLM) fallback when local detection confidence is below 70% OR after 3 consecutive detection timeouts/failures (>3s each)

**Equipment Verification**
- **FR-006**: System MUST display EquipmentChecklist of required equipment for current job/truck
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically mark EquipmentChecklist items as verified when detected with >70% confidence
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow manual verification toggle for each EquipmentChecklist item
- **FR-008a**: System MUST automatically switch to manual checklist mode when camera is unavailable
- **FR-009**: System MUST capture and store final verification photo with all metadata
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent job start when required equipment items are unverified

**Offline Capability**
- **FR-011**: System MUST function fully offline for equipment detection and verification
- **FR-012**: System MUST queue verification records locally when network unavailable
- **FR-013**: System MUST automatically sync queued verifications when network restored
- **FR-014**: System MUST display clear offline/online status indicator to user
- **FR-015**: System MUST preserve up to 200 verification records in offline queue (1 week typical capacity)

**User Feedback**
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide real-time visual feedback during detection process
- **FR-016a**: System MUST prompt user to reposition camera when equipment is partially visible or cut off in frame (prompt appears within 500ms of partial detection, clears within 500ms of successful repositioning)
- **FR-017**: System MUST display processing status for cloud vision requests
- **FR-018**: System MUST show clear success/failure states after verification
- **FR-019**: System MUST highlight missing equipment items in red/warning color

- **FR-021**: System MUST complete on-device detection within 1 second per frame
- **FR-022**: System MUST complete full verification workflow within 30 seconds
- **FR-023**: System MUST load camera feed within 2 seconds of page load

**Data & Privacy**
- **FR-025**: System MUST store verification records with timestamp, user, location, and photo
