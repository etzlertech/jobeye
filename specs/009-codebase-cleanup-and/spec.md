# Feature Specification: Codebase Cleanup and Refactoring

**Feature Branch**: `009-codebase-cleanup-and`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "codebase cleanup and refactoring based on JOBEYE_CLEANUP_PLAN.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Parsed: "codebase cleanup and refactoring based on JOBEYE_CLEANUP_PLAN.md"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identified: cleanup, refactoring, plan document reference
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Reference to external plan document (JOBEYE_CLEANUP_PLAN.md) provides detailed scope
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Developer workflows and system health validation scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement derived from plan document objectives
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → Database schema changes, code structure patterns
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All sections completed based on plan document
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: What rollback time window should the migration system support? → A: Immediate rollback only (within same deployment window)
- Q: Which inventory category set should the unified model support? → A: Extended categories: equipment, material, consumable, tool
- Q: When should the CI/CD pipeline verify database schema alignment? → A: Only when commits include database/schema changes
- Q: How should the system handle existing legacy code that uses deprecated patterns? → A: Immediate refactor - update all legacy code in one pass
- Q: Which test coverage metric should be maintained at ≥80%? → A: Line coverage only
- Q: How should the system decide whether to remove or document each orphaned table? → A: Analyze code references first, remove only if no code dependencies exist
- Q: How should the system handle the empty container tables that have repository implementations? → A: Keep tables and populate with test data to match implementations
- Q: What validation layers should prevent reintroduction of deprecated patterns? → A: ESLint + pre-commit + CI/CD gates (multi-layer checking)

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on JobEye, I need a consistent and clean codebase so that I can efficiently implement new features, fix bugs, and maintain the system without confusion from conflicting patterns, duplicate code, or unclear domain boundaries.

### Database State Context
The current database contains 692 rows of test data across 157 tables. Analysis shows:
- 15 tables still use `company_id` instead of `tenant_id`
- 127 tables are orphaned (no relationships, no data)
- Container-related tables exist but are empty despite having code implementations

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer searching for tenant isolation code, **When** they search for tenant-related fields, **Then** they find only `tenant_id` references with no `company_id` confusion
2. **Given** a developer implementing container-related features, **When** they look for the container repository, **Then** they find exactly one implementation with clear documentation
3. **Given** a developer creating a new repository, **When** they check existing patterns, **Then** they find only class-based repositories following a consistent pattern
4. **Given** a developer deploying changes, **When** the CI pipeline runs, **Then** it automatically verifies database schema alignment and prevents drift
5. **Given** an AI agent working on the codebase, **When** it needs architectural guidance, **Then** it finds comprehensive documentation in AGENTS.md

### Edge Cases
- Legacy code referencing old patterns will be immediately refactored in one comprehensive pass
- Test data (692 rows) will be preserved during tenant_id migration with validation
- Container tables (containers, container_assignments) are empty but will be seeded with test data to validate implementations
- Multi-layer validation (ESLint, pre-commit, CI/CD) prevents reintroduction of deprecated patterns

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST use a single, consistent tenant identifier field (`tenant_id`) across all database tables and code
- **FR-002**: System MUST have only one implementation for each repository type (no duplicate container repositories)
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce consistent repository patterns (class-based with dependency injection)
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically verify database schema matches migration files during CI/CD when commits include database or schema changes
- **FR-005**: System MUST consolidate equipment, inventory, and material tracking into a unified domain model
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide developer documentation covering: (1) all repository patterns with examples, (2) tenant isolation guidelines, (3) migration procedures, (4) troubleshooting guide with >10 common issues, (5) architectural decision records for cleanup choices
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent reintroduction of deprecated patterns through ESLint rules, pre-commit hooks, and CI/CD gates
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality during and after the refactoring
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve all existing data during schema migrations with immediate rollback capability (within same deployment window)
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain or improve line coverage (≥80%) throughout the cleanup process
- **FR-011**: System MUST analyze code references for 127 orphaned tables and remove only those with no code dependencies after explicit migration plan approval documenting each DROP operation
- **FR-012**: System MUST migrate these specific tables from `company_id` to `tenant_id`: day_plans, equipment_maintenance, inventory_images, kit_assignments, notification_queue, notifications, ocr_documents, ocr_jobs, ocr_line_items, ocr_note_entities, vendor_aliases, vendor_locations
- **FR-013**: System MUST seed empty tables that have existing code implementations with appropriate test data for development validation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tenant Identifier**: Standardized field for multi-tenant isolation, replacing mixed tenant_id/company_id usage
- **Repository Pattern**: Consistent class-based structure for all data access operations
- **Inventory Domain**: Unified model with four categories (equipment, material, consumable, tool) and tracking mode attributes
- **Migration System**: Automated schema verification and application process
- **Documentation Structure**: Organized hierarchy for architecture decisions, patterns, and developer guidance
