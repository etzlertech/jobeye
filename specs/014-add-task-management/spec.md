# Feature Specification: Task Management for Reusable Task Library

**Feature Branch**: `014-add-task-management`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add Task Management to supervisor dashboard for managing individual reusable tasks. This is different from Task Template Management (which manages groups of tasks). Need:
- Task Management tile on supervisor dashboard
- Task Management screen to create, edit, delete reusable task definitions
- Each task should have: name, description, acceptance criteria, requires_photo_verification, requires_supervisor_approval, is_required flag
- Task Detail screen for editing (similar to Task Template Detail)
- Tasks can be used as building blocks when creating Task Templates
- Separate from Workflow Tasks (which are instances attached to jobs)
- Two buttons on dashboard: "Task Templates" (manages groups) and "Tasks" (manages individual reusable tasks)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a supervisor**, I want to create and manage a library of reusable task definitions so that I can build task templates more efficiently without redefining common tasks each time.

**As a supervisor**, I want to access task management separately from task template management so that I can maintain individual building blocks independently from the grouped templates that use them.

**As a supervisor**, I want to define task requirements (photo verification, supervisor approval, required/optional) at the task definition level so that these settings are consistent when I use the task in multiple templates.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a supervisor is on the supervisor dashboard, **When** they view the navigation tiles, **Then** they must see two separate tiles: "Task Templates" and "Tasks"

2. **Given** a supervisor clicks the "Tasks" tile, **When** the task management screen loads, **Then** they must see a list of all existing reusable task definitions with options to create new tasks

3. **Given** a supervisor wants to create a new task definition, **When** they click "Create Task", **Then** they must be able to enter: task name, description, acceptance criteria, and set flags for photo verification requirement, supervisor approval requirement, and whether the task is required by default

4. **Given** a supervisor has created a task definition, **When** they view the task list, **Then** they must see the task with its name and key attributes displayed

5. **Given** a supervisor wants to edit an existing task, **When** they click on a task from the list, **Then** they must be taken to a Task Detail screen where they can modify all task properties

6. **Given** a supervisor is editing a task definition, **When** they save changes, **Then** the task library must be updated and the changes must be available for use in task templates

7. **Given** a supervisor wants to delete a task definition, **When** they request deletion from the task list or detail screen, **Then** the system must allow deletion if the task is not currently in use

8. **Given** a supervisor is creating or editing a task template, **When** they add tasks to the template, **Then** they must be able to select from the reusable task library

9. **Given** a task definition is used in multiple task templates, **When** a supervisor edits the task definition, **Then** the change must not automatically update existing workflow task instances (tasks are copied, not referenced)

10. **Given** a supervisor views the task management screen, **When** the screen loads, **Then** it must be visually distinct from the task template management screen but follow the same UI patterns

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a supervisor tries to delete a task definition that is currently used in one or more task templates?
  - System must either prevent deletion with a warning showing which templates use it, or allow deletion with a confirmation that templates will retain their copies

- What happens when a supervisor creates a task with the same name as an existing task?
  - System must allow duplicate names (tasks are identified by unique ID) but may warn the user

- What happens when a supervisor is editing a task and another supervisor deletes it?
  - System must detect the conflict and notify the user that the task no longer exists

- What happens when a workflow task instance already exists and its source task definition is later modified?
  - Workflow task instances must remain unchanged (they are snapshots at creation time)

- What happens when a supervisor creates a task definition but doesn't save it?
  - System should either auto-save drafts or warn the user before navigating away

- What happens if required fields (name, description) are left empty?
  - System must validate and prevent saving incomplete task definitions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task Definition (Reusable Task)**: A reusable building block stored in the task library. Contains: unique identifier, tenant association, task name, task description, acceptance criteria (optional), requires_photo_verification flag, requires_supervisor_approval flag, is_required flag (default setting), created_by user reference, created_at timestamp, updated_at timestamp. Purpose: Serve as templates for creating workflow tasks via task templates.

- **Task Template**: A collection of task definitions grouped together for a specific job type. Contains: template name, description, job type, ordered list of task definition copies. Purpose: Enable quick job creation by instantiating all tasks in the template. Relationship: References task definitions at creation time but stores copies.

- **Workflow Task**: An instance of a task attached to a specific job. Contains: all fields from the source task definition (at creation time) plus: job reference, status, completion data, verification photos. Purpose: Track actual work completion. Relationship: Created from task definition copy in a template; independent after creation.

- **Supervisor Dashboard Tile**: A navigation element on the supervisor dashboard. Contains: tile title, icon, description, navigation target. Purpose: Provide quick access to major features. Two tiles added: "Tasks" (task library management) and "Task Templates" (template management).

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### Assumptions
1. Task definitions are tenant-scoped (each organization maintains its own library)
2. Task names do not need to be unique within a tenant (identified by ID)
3. Workflow task instances are independent snapshots (not live references)
4. Task deletion is soft (can be recovered) or hard (permanent) - to be decided in planning
5. Task categorization/tagging is out of scope for this phase

### Dependencies
1. Existing Task Template Management system must be in place
2. Supervisor dashboard must exist with tile-based navigation
3. Workflow task system must support creation from task definitions
4. Authentication and authorization system must support supervisor role checks
5. Tenant isolation must be implemented in the database layer

### Out of Scope
- Task categorization or tagging system
- Advanced search/filter capabilities beyond alphabetical sorting
- Task versioning or audit trail (may be added later)
- Bulk import/export of task definitions
- Task sharing across tenants
- Task usage analytics or reporting
