## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: When local detection fails completely AND there's no internet connectivity for cloud fallback, how should the system behave? ‚Üí A: Allow with warning - technician can proceed but system logs unverified kit and flags for supervisor review
- Q: What is the confidence threshold percentage for escalating from local detection to cloud analysis? ‚Üí A: 70%
- Q: What is the daily budget cap for cloud vision analysis per company? ‚Üí A: $10/day
- Q: What is the target maximum time for local detection processing on mobile devices? ‚Üí A: 3 seconds
- Q: How long should verification photos be retained before automatic deletion? ‚Üí A: 1 year
- Q: What is the photo capture frame rate when camera is active? ‚Üí A: 1 frame per second, continues until user intent and all objects detected
- Q: What is the offline photo queue capacity? ‚Üí A: 50 photos before requiring sync

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A field technician preparing for the day's jobs needs to verify they have loaded all required equipment and materials for their assigned kit. Instead of manually checking each item against a paper checklist (which takes 5-10 minutes and is error-prone), they open the mobile app, point their camera at the loaded truck bed, and take a single photo. The system automatically identifies all visible items, compares them against the required kit definition, and confirms whether the load is complete or highlights missing items. This verification happens instantly even without internet connectivity, with results saved for supervisor review.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a technician has loaded their truck with a "Small Yard Kit" **When** they take a photo of the truck bed **Then** the system identifies all visible items (mower, trimmer, blower) and displays "Kit Verified ‚úì" with a green confirmation

2. **Given** a technician is missing a required item (chainsaw) from their kit **When** they take a verification photo **Then** the system highlights "Missing: Chainsaw" in red and prompts them to either load the item or log an override reason

3. **Given** the technician is in an area with no internet connectivity **When** they take a verification photo **Then** the system processes the image locally, provides immediate feedback, and queues the result for later sync

4. **Given** the local detection system has low confidence in its results (unclear image, poor lighting) **When** verification completes **Then** the system requests permission to send the photo to a cloud service for enhanced analysis, showing the estimated cost before proceeding

5. **Given** a technician has items split across multiple containers (truck bed, trailer, storage bins) **When** they take photos of each container **Then** the system associates detected items with their respective containers and shows which container holds which equipment

6. **Given** a supervisor reviewing end-of-day reports **When** they open the verification history **Then** they see all kit verification attempts, success rates, frequently missing items, and photos of incomplete loads for coaching opportunities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the photo is too dark or blurry to process reliably?
- How does the system handle items that look similar (different models of the same equipment type)?
- What if the technician takes a photo before the truck is fully loaded?
- How does the system behave when the kit definition changes mid-day (seasonal variant switch)?
- When offline detection fails and there's no connectivity for cloud fallback, technician can proceed with warning and system flags for supervisor review
- How does the system handle items that are partially visible or stacked on top of each other?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Verification
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow technicians to initiate kit verification by taking a photo through the mobile app camera
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect and identify equipment/materials visible in verification photos

- **FR-005**: System MUST complete verification and display results within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable time limit - 30 seconds? 1 minute?] of photo capture

#### Offline Operation
- **FR-006**: System MUST perform item detection locally on the device without requiring internet connectivity
- **FR-007**: System MUST queue verification results for sync when connectivity is unavailable
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide the same verification workflow whether online or offline
- **FR-009**: System MUST cache kit definitions locally so technicians can verify loads without connectivity

#### Cost Optimization
- **FR-010**: System MUST attempt local detection first before using cloud-based analysis services
- **FR-011**: System MUST only escalate to cloud analysis when local detection confidence is below 70%
- **FR-012**: System MUST display estimated cost to the user before sending photos to cloud services
