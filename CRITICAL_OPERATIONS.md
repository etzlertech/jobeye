# CRITICAL OPERATIONS - EXACT STEPS FOR EVERY SESSION

## üî¥ 1. DIRECT DATABASE CONNECTION (ALWAYS USE THIS)

### Python Script Method (PROVEN TO WORK)
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests
import json

# Supabase credentials from .env.local
# Get these from .env.local
SUPABASE_URL = "<NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL from .env.local>"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY = "<SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY from .env.local>"

headers = {
    "apikey": SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY,
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

def exec_sql(sql):
    """Execute SQL via Supabase RPC - WORKS RELIABLY"""
    url = f"{SUPABASE_URL}/rest/v1/rpc/exec_sql"
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json={"sql": sql})
    return response.status_code == 204  # 204 = Success
```

### What DOESN'T Work:
- ‚ùå Node.js scripts with require('@supabase/supabase-js') - module resolution fails
- ‚ùå TypeScript scripts with tsx - dependency issues
- ‚ùå Direct psql commands - not available
- ‚ùå Supabase CLI commands - connection errors

## üî¥ 2. GIT PUSH TO MAIN (EXACT WORKING METHOD)

### Step 1: Configure Git Authentication
```bash
# Set the authenticated remote URL with PAT token
git remote set-url origin https://<GITHUB_PAT>@github.com/etzlertech/jobeye.git

# Configure credential helper
git config credential.helper store
echo "https://<GITHUB_PAT>:x-oauth-basic@github.com" > ~/.git-credentials
```

### Step 2: Commit and Push
```bash
# Add files
git add <files>

# Commit with proper format
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type: your commit message here

)"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

### What DOESN'T Work:
- ‚ùå git push without authentication setup - returns 403 error
- ‚ùå Using GITHUB_PAT environment variable - it's commented out in .env.local

## üî¥ 3. RAILWAY MONITORING (ACTIVE, NOT PASSIVE)

### The Problem:
- Node.js module resolution is broken in WSL environment
- node_modules directories exist but many are empty
- This affects all Node.js based scripts

### Working Solution - Python Railway Monitor:
```bash
# Use the Python monitoring script
python3 scripts/railway-monitor.py

# This will:
# - Show latest commit hash
# - Warn about uncommitted changes  
# - Monitor for 3 minutes with progress updates
# - Tell you when deployment should be complete
```

### Alternative Manual Method:
```bash
# 1. Note the time of push
git push origin main
echo "Pushed at $(date)"

# 2. Wait 2-3 minutes (Railway typical deploy time)
sleep 180

# 3. Test with Browser MCP
```

### What NOT to Do:
- ‚ùå DON'T wait blindly for 5 minutes
- ‚ùå DON'T assume deployment succeeded without verification
- ‚ùå DON'T test before deployment completes

## üî¥ 4. COMPLETE WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

```bash
# 1. Make code changes
# Edit files as needed

# 2. Check what changed
git status

# 3. Setup git auth (only needed once per session)
git remote set-url origin https://<GITHUB_PAT>@github.com/etzlertech/jobeye.git
git config credential.helper store
echo "https://<GITHUB_PAT>:x-oauth-basic@github.com" > ~/.git-credentials

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix: your change description

)"
git push origin main

# 5. Note deployment start time
echo "Deployment started at $(date)"

# 6. Wait 2-3 minutes (Railway typical deploy time)
sleep 180

# 7. Test with Browser MCP
# Navigate to https://jobeye-production.up.railway.app
```

## üî¥ 5. DEPENDENCIES ISSUE

### Root Cause:
- Node.js module resolution is broken in this WSL environment
- Many node_modules directories exist but are empty (corrupted installation)
- This affects ALL Node.js scripts including tsx, dotenv, etc.

### Working Solutions:
1. **Database Operations**: Use Python scripts (shown above)
2. **Git Operations**: Use bash commands directly  
3. **Railway Monitoring**: Use `python3 scripts/railway-monitor.py`
4. **Avoid**: Any Node.js based scripts until node_modules are fixed

### To Fix Node Modules (for future sessions):
```bash
# Complete reinstall might help
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
