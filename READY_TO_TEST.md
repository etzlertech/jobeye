# Scheduling Module - Ready for Interactive Testing

## What's Ready

✅ **Interactive Test Harness** - Test scheduling with real-world values
✅ **Real Database Operations** - All CRUD operations work
✅ **Conflict Detection** - Test overlaps, travel time, breaks
✅ **Business Rules** - 6-job limit, validation
✅ **Multi-tenant Testing** - RLS validation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run the interactive test harness
npx tsx scripts/test-scheduling-interactive.ts
```

You'll get a menu:
```
1. Create Day Plan
2. Add Schedule Events
3. Check Conflicts
4. Query Day Plans
5. Test 6-Job Limit
6. Test RLS (Multi-tenant)
7. Run All Tests
8. Cleanup
9. Exit
```

## What to Test

### Input Real-World Values

Instead of UI, just type values directly:

**Example:**
```
Select option: 1
Enter plan date: 2025-10-15
✅ Day plan created!

Select option: 2
How many jobs: 4
✅ Job 1 created at 8:00 AM
✅ Job 2 created at 9:30 AM
✅ Job 3 created at 11:00 AM
✅ Job 4 created at 12:30 PM
```

### Test Scenarios to Try

1. **Normal workday**: Create plan, add 4 jobs, check conflicts
2. **Busy day**: Try to add 7 jobs (should block at 6)
3. **Conflicts**: Add overlapping jobs, see detection work
4. **Queries**: Create multiple plans, filter by date range
5. **Multi-tenant**: Create for different companies, verify isolation

## What You'll Discover

This will reveal:
- ❓ Any database constraint issues
- ❓ Business rule bugs
- ❓ Conflict detection accuracy
- ❓ RLS policy gaps
- ❓ Performance problems
- ❓ Edge cases we missed

## Benefits vs UI

**Test Harness:**
- ✅ Tests real database immediately
- ✅ See actual errors and SQL codes
- ✅ Easy to test edge cases
- ✅ Fast iteration
- ✅ Can automate scenarios

**UI:**
- Nice for users
- Slower to build
- Harder to test edge cases
- Can't test as many scenarios quickly

## After Testing

Once you've tested thoroughly:
1. Document any bugs found
2. Fix critical issues
3. Then either:
   - Build UI (validated foundation)
   - Move to voice/jobs (proven stable)

## Documentation

- `SCHEDULING_TEST_HARNESS.md` - Full testing guide
- `scripts/test-scheduling-interactive.ts` - The test harness code
- `SCHEDULING_FINAL_STATUS.md` - Implementation details

## What to Look For

### ✅ Should Work:
- Creating day plans
- Adding 1-6 jobs
- Querying plans
- Conflict detection
- Date filtering

### ❌ Known Issues:
- Some test isolation (already documented)
- RLS needs anon key client (uses service role now)

### ❓ Unknown:
- Performance with many events
- Complex conflict scenarios
- Edge case date handling
- Concurrent modifications
