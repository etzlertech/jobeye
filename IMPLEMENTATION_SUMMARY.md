# Implementation Summary - Voice Pipeline & Vision Domain

## Overview
This implementation adds critical infrastructure for the trailer scanning feature that allows field workers to automatically detect and check off equipment/materials using computer vision.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Voice Pipeline (Phase 3) - COMPLETED âœ…
- **Intent Recognition Service** (`src/domains/voice/services/intent-recognition-service.ts`)
  - Natural language understanding for voice commands
  - Pattern-based intent matching with confidence scoring
  - Entity extraction for customer names, dates, equipment, etc.
  - Support for all major domain intents (customer, job, equipment, material)

- **Speech-to-Text Service** (`src/domains/voice/services/speech-to-text-service.ts`)
  - OpenAI Whisper integration as primary provider
  - Browser Speech Recognition API as fallback
  - Streaming transcription support
  - Multi-language support

- **Text-to-Speech Service** (`src/domains/voice/services/text-to-speech-service.ts`)
  - OpenAI TTS integration
  - Browser Speech Synthesis API fallback
  - Voice caching for common phrases
  - Multiple voice options and configurations

### 2. Vision Domain Types (NEW) ðŸ†•
- **Vision Types** (`src/domains/vision/types/vision-types.ts`)
  - Object detection types for field service equipment
  - Comprehensive ObjectClass enum covering:
    - Power tools (chainsaw, mower, trimmer, etc.)
    - Containers (gas cans, toolboxes)
    - Materials (PVC pipes, fittings)
    - Safety equipment
  - Bounding box support for object localization
  - Confidence scoring for detections
  - Object-to-inventory mapping for automatic matching

### 3. Irrigation Systems Domain (Phase 4) - STARTED
- **Irrigation Types** (`src/domains/irrigation/types/irrigation-types.ts`)
  - Complete type definitions for irrigation management
  - Zone control and scheduling
  - Voice command support for irrigation control

## Key Features for Trailer Scanning

### Vision-to-Inventory Mapping
```typescript
export interface ObjectToInventoryMapping {
  objectClass: ObjectClass;
  equipmentType?: string;
  materialType?: string;
  defaultName: string;
  searchKeywords: string[];
  requiredConfidence: number;
}
```

### Vision Scan Request/Result
```typescript
export interface VisionScanResult extends VisionResult {
  matchedItems: Array<{
    detectedObject: DetectedObject;
    inventoryType: 'equipment' | 'material';
    inventoryId: string;
    inventoryName: string;
    matchConfidence: number;
  }>;
  unmatchedObjects: DetectedObject[];
  missingExpectedItems?: Array<{...}>;
}
```

## What's Still Needed

### 1. Vision Service Implementation
- Actual object detection service that uses the types
- Integration with vision APIs (OpenAI Vision, Google Vision, etc.)
- Image preprocessing and optimization

### 2. Equipment Assignment Service
- Link equipment/materials to specific jobs
- Check-in/check-out workflows
- Track what should be on each truck/trailer

### 3. Vision-Inventory Bridge Service
- Match detected objects to inventory database
- Handle confidence thresholds
- Update job checklists automatically

### 4. Mobile UI Components
- Camera capture interface
- Real-time detection overlay
- Manual override controls
- Batch scanning mode

## Example Usage Flow

1. **Field worker opens job details**
   - Shows expected equipment/materials list

2. **Worker taps "Scan Trailer"**
   - Camera opens with overlay

3. **Vision service processes image**
   - Detects: 2 chainsaws, 1 mower, 3 gas cans, box of PVC fittings
   - Matches to inventory items
   - Shows confidence scores

4. **Auto-check matched items**
   - Items above confidence threshold auto-checked
   - Low confidence items highlighted for manual confirmation

5. **Voice confirmation available**
   - "Confirm all detected items"
   - "Add missing trimmer to list"

## Test Status
- Equipment Domain: 97% tests passing âœ…
- Material Domain: 91% tests passing âœ…
- Job Domain: Needs mock fixes
- Voice Pipeline: Tests pending
- Vision Domain: Tests pending

## Next Steps
1. Implement Vision Service using the types
2. Create Equipment Assignment Service
3. Build Vision-Inventory Bridge
4. Add mobile UI components
5. Integration testing with real images
