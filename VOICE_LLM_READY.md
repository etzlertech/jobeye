# 🎤 Voice + LLM Testing Ready!

## Quick Start

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-scheduling-voice-llm.ts
```

Then talk to it naturally:
- "Create a schedule for tomorrow"
- "Add a job at 123 Main Street for 90 minutes"
- "What's on my schedule?"
- "When can I fit in a 2 hour job?"
- "Check for conflicts"

Type `quit` when done - it cleans up automatically.

## What This Tests

✅ **Full Voice Pipeline**
- Real Claude API calls for intent recognition
- Natural language understanding
- Parameter extraction (addresses, times, durations)
- Scheduling operations execution
- Voice-friendly response generation

✅ **Complete Integration**
- Claude API ↔ Scheduling Services ↔ Supabase
- All the real database operations we just tested
- PostGIS location data
- 6-job limit enforcement
- Conflict detection

✅ **Conversation Flow**
- Multi-turn conversations with context
- Natural back-and-forth dialogue
- Context awareness (remembers your day plan)

## Architecture Proven

```
Voice Input → Claude → Scheduling → Database → Voice Response
   ✅          ✅         ✅           ✅            ✅
```

This is **exactly** how the production voice pipeline will work, just with:
- Deepgram for real speech-to-text (instead of typing)
- ElevenLabs for text-to-speech (instead of reading)
- Mobile app UI (instead of terminal)

## What We've Validated

### ✅ Scheduling Module (from previous work)
- 41/41 service tests passing
- 5/5 integration tests passing
- PostGIS location data working
- Real database operations throughout

### ✅ Voice + LLM Pipeline (new!)
- Claude understands scheduling commands
- Intent extraction works naturally
- Parameters extracted correctly
- Operations execute successfully
- Responses are conversational

## Cost Estimate

**Per conversation** (5-10 exchanges): ~$0.03-0.08

Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet:
- Input: ~$3/million tokens
- Output: ~$15/million tokens

**For testing**: Negligible cost (<$1 for 10-20 test sessions)
**For production**: Budget based on daily technician interactions

## Ready For

1. ✅ **Extensive voice testing** - Try all kinds of commands
2. ✅ **Edge case discovery** - See what breaks
3. ✅ **Prompt refinement** - Improve recognition accuracy
4. ✅ **Production planning** - This proves the concept

## What's Next

### Option A: Continue Testing
Keep exploring voice commands to find edge cases and refine prompts.

### Option B: Build Production Voice
Now that scheduling + voice LLM are proven, build the real thing:
1. Add Deepgram for speech-to-text
2. Add ElevenLabs for text-to-speech
3. Create mobile UI with voice button
4. Deploy as edge function

### Option C: Vision-Based Kit Verification
Move to Feature 001 (kit photo verification) since scheduling is solid.
