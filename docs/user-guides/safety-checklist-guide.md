**Categories**:
- 🦺 **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: Hard hat, safety glasses, gloves, boots, vest
- 🔧 **Equipment Safety**: Pre-use inspection, guards in place, proper operation

## Best Practices

### For Crews

**Pre-Job Checklist Completion**:
- ✅ Complete pre-job items before unloading equipment
- ✅ Take photos in good lighting
- ✅ Don't rush through checklist
- ✅ Actually perform the safety check (don't just check boxes)
- ❌ Don't check items you haven't actually done
- ❌ Don't reuse old photos

**Photo Tips**:
- Take photos from 3-6 feet away (optimal distance)
- Ensure subject is centered and in focus
- Use landscape orientation for equipment photos
- Use portrait orientation for PPE photos
- Avoid direct sunlight behind subject (backlit)

**Time Management**:
- Checklist typically takes 3-5 minutes
- Build into job time estimates
- Don't skip to save time (safety first)

### For Supervisors

**Review Frequency**:
- Review pending checklists daily
- Prioritize checklists for high-risk jobs
- Provide feedback promptly (within 24 hours)

**Photo Review Standards**:
- Be consistent in what you approve/reject
- Provide clear feedback on why photo rejected
- Don't be overly nitpicky (balance compliance with efficiency)
- Focus on genuine safety verification

**Coaching, Not Punishing**:
- First non-compliance: Educate and coach
- Second non-compliance: Formal conversation
- Repeat non-compliance: Disciplinary action
- Goal: Safety culture, not punishment

### For Safety Coordinators

**Checklist Design**:
- Keep checklists concise (10-15 items max)
- Only require photos for critical safety items
- Group related items together
- Use clear, actionable language
- Avoid jargon or abbreviations

**Photo Requirements**:
- Require photos for:
  - PPE compliance
  - Critical equipment safety (guards, brakes)
  - Site hazard management (cones, signs)
  - Proof of compliance (cleanup, securing)
- Don't require photos for:
  - Simple checks that can't be effectively photographed
  - Items where checking the box is sufficient

**Continuous Improvement**:
- Review checklist completion data monthly
- Survey crews about checklist clarity
- Identify items frequently skipped (may need revision)
