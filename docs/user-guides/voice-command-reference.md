- "Mark it complete" completes the currently open job
- "Call them" calls the customer for the current job

**Examples**:
1. You: "What's my next job?"
   JobEye: "Your next job is lawn mowing at 123 Main St for John Smith."
   You: "Navigate there"
   JobEye: *Starts navigation to 123 Main St*

2. You: "Show job for Jane Doe"
   JobEye: *Opens job details*
   You: "Call her"
   JobEye: *Calls Jane Doe*

### Multi-Turn Conversations

**JobEye Can Ask Follow-Up Questions**:

**Example: Adding Tasks**
- You: "Add task"
- JobEye: "What task did you complete?"
- You: "Mowed lawn"
- JobEye: "Task added: Mowed lawn"

**Example: Reporting Incident**
- You: "Report incident"
- JobEye: "What type of incident?" (Shows options)
- You: "Near miss"
- JobEye: "Describe what happened"
- You: "Almost tripped on sprinkler head"
- JobEye: "Incident reported. Do you need supervisor notification?"
- You: "Yes"
- JobEye: "Supervisor notified"

### Corrections

**Fixing Transcription Errors**:
- If JobEye misunderstands, say:
  - "No, I said [correction]"
  - "That's wrong, I meant [correction]"
  - "Incorrect, [correction]"

**Example**:
- You: "Navigate to main street"
- JobEye: "Navigate to Maine Street?" (mishears)
- You: "No, Main Street, M-A-I-N"
- JobEye: "Got it, Main Street. Starting navigation."

## FAQs

**Q: Does JobEye voice work in noisy environments?**
A: Voice works best in moderate noise (conversation-level). Very noisy environments (mowers, blowers) may reduce accuracy. Move to quieter area or pause equipment briefly.

**Q: Can I use voice while wearing gloves?**
A: Yes, if using push-to-talk mode or voice activation. Touchless operation is the main benefit of voice.

**Q: Does voice work with Bluetooth headsets?**
A: Yes, JobEye supports Bluetooth headsets with built-in microphones. Audio plays through headset speakers.

**Q: What languages does voice support?**
A: Currently English only. Additional languages coming soon.

**Q: Can supervisors listen to my voice recordings?**
A: No. Voice audio is only used for command processing. Supervisors see the transcription text (e.g., "Added task: Mowed lawn") but not the audio.

**Q: How accurate is voice recognition?**
A: 95%+ accuracy in ideal conditions (quiet environment, clear speech). Accuracy may decrease with background noise or accented speech.

**Q: Can I use voice commands while driving?**
A: Yes, voice is designed for hands-free use. Use responsibly and obey traffic laws. Don't look at screen while driving.

**Q: What if voice adds the wrong task?**
A: Review transcription on screen before confirming. Say "No, I said [correction]" to fix. You can also delete/edit tasks after adding.

**Q: Can I customize voice commands?**
A: Not currently. All users have the same command set. Custom commands may be added in future updates.

**Q: Does voice cost extra?**
A: No, voice is included in all JobEye plans at no extra cost.
