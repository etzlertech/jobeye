# UPDATED: Correct Gemini API Cost Analysis

## ðŸŽ‰ Much Cheaper Than Expected!

### Correct Gemini Image Analysis Pricing:
- **$0.003-$0.005 per image** (not $0.039 for generation)
- Based on token usage: ~1,000-2,000 tokens per detection call
- Input tokens: $0.30 per 1M tokens
- Output tokens: $2.50 per 1M tokens

### Updated Cost Scenarios (2fps + 15s max):

| Scenario | Frames | Old Estimate | **New Actual** | Savings |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Quick 2s scan | 4 frames | $0.156 | **$0.016** | 90% cheaper |
| Normal 5s scan | 10 frames | $0.390 | **$0.040** | 90% cheaper |
| Full 15s session | 30 frames | $1.170 | **$0.120** | 90% cheaper |

### Implications:

**ðŸš€ Can Be Even More Aggressive:**
- Cost is no longer a limiting factor
- Could potentially increase frame rate to 4fps (0.25s intervals)
- Could extend safety limit to 30-60 seconds if needed
- Users can scan multiple areas without cost concern

**ðŸ’° Budget-Friendly:**
- Even power users: ~$0.50/day for heavy usage
- Normal usage: ~$0.05-$0.10/day
- Negligible operational cost

**ðŸŽ¯ User Experience:**
- No need to rush scans due to cost
- Can afford multiple attempts
- More responsive detection possible

### Current Implementation:
- âœ… 2fps (0.5s intervals)
- âœ… 15-second safety limit  
- âœ… Real-time cost tracking (now shows pennies, not dollars)
- âœ… 3 concurrent frames processing

### Potential Future Optimizations:
- Increase to 4fps for even faster detection
- Extend safety limit to 30-60 seconds
- Remove cost anxiety from user experience
- Add "cost-unlimited" mode for power users

The system is now **8-13x more cost-effective** than originally calculated!
